                                    A ratio is a comparison between two (2) quantities, and it is often
                                    expressed as a fraction, eg. \(\frac{3}{4}\) or a decimal. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    For instance, a ratio of <strong>3:4</strong> or \(\frac{3}{4}\) means that
                                    for every three (3) units of one quantity, there are 4 units of another
                                    quantity.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Ratios are often used when it comes to sharing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Assuming your mother brought home 15 toffees to be shared between you and your
                                    brother. Your brother, who is 2 times older than you, could say that once he is 
                                    older than you, he needs to get more share of the toffees than you.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Your mother could decide to share the toffees according to your ages. Since your brother
                                    is twice (2 times) your age, every time your mother gives you one of the toffees, she
                                    will give your brother 2.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This method of sharing will continue until the toffees are exhausted.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Mathematically, we can say that, your mother shared the toffees in the ratio 1 is to 2
                                    <strong>(that is, 1:2)</strong>.

                                    We need to first convert one of the distances, so they are both expressed in the same
                                    unit. Let's convert the bigger unit (kilometer) to the smaller unit (meter).

                                    \(1 km = 1000 m\) <br>
                                    \(\therefore 4 km = \frac{4 km}{1 km} \times 1000 m\) &emsp; &emsp; (If more, less divide) <br>
                                    \(\hspace{2.2cm} = 4 \times 1000 m\) <br>
                                    \(\hspace{2.2cm}= 4000 m\) <br>
                                    \(\therefore\) Kwame's distance is \(4000 m\). <br> <br>

                                    \(\hspace{2.2cm} = 4000cm\) <br>
                                    This implies; <br>

                                    \(\therefore\) the ratio of 80cm to 40m is \(1:50\) <br>
