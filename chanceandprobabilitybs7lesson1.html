                                    Sometimes we want to find the likelihood that an event will happen. 
                                    The concept in Mathematics that helps us to determine this chance of
                                    an event happening is called Probability.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In this lesson, we learn about <strong>events</strong>, types of events,
                                    that is certain events, uncertain or impossible events and possible events.
                                </p>

                                    An event is a cause, happening or experiment that produces an outcome
                                    or a number of outcomes.

                                    1. The event of tossing a coin. <br>
                                    2. The event of tossing a dice. <br>

                                    A certain event is an event that will always, or definitely, occur. Certain events have a probability
                                    of 1. 
                                </p>

                                    Examples of certain events are: <br>
                                    1. The event that Ghana will continue to be an African country tomorrow. <br>
                                    2. The event that the number 2 will still be called a prime number in two weeks from now. <br>
                                    3. The event of rolling a die and getting a number between 1 and 6.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Impossible events are events that cannot occur. They have a probability of zero (0).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Examples of impossible events are: <br>
                                    1. The event that a dog will fly tomorrow. <br>
                                    2. The event of rolling a die and getting a number that is greater than 6. <br>
                                    3. The event that a new-born baby will be able to run the following day. <br>
                                    4. The event that when a coin is tossed, neither a head nor a tail appears.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Possible events on the other hand are events that may or may not occur. Their probability lies
                                    between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). For this reason, they are mostly expressed as fractions \((\frac{a}{b})\).

                                    Examples of possible events are: <br>
                                    1. Rolling a die and getting an even number. <br>
                                    2. The event that, a coin, when tossed lands heads side up. <br>
                                    3. The event that it will rain tomorrow. <br>
                                    4. The event that Manchester United will beat Real Madrid in a cup final.

                                    representing possible events.

                                    Consider the event of throwing a die. A die has six sides with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
                                    and 6 each on a side. We call each of these numbers a possible outcome in the event of
                                    of throwing the die.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is because, when the die is thrown, only one of the numbers appear at the top
                                    when it falls. So there are 6 possible outcomes in the event of throwing a die. And out 
                                    of these 6 possible outcomes only 1 of the outcomes is successful.

                                    The number 1 is one of the 6 possible outcomes when a fair die is thrown, hence
                                    it also has a probability of \(\frac{1}{6}\).

                                    <strong>Probability(Obtaining 1) = \(\frac{1 \ outcome}{6 \ possible \ outcomes} \) </strong> <br>

                                    Can you guess the probability of obtaining the number 7?

                                    Remember, in throwing a die, your set of possible
                                    outcomes is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Meaning the event of obtaining the number 7 is an impossible event, hence 
                                    has a probability of zero (0).

                                <p>
                                    The event of obtaining the number 4 is also a possible event, and has a probability of \(\frac{1}{6}\).

                                    From the above table, you can see that when two dice are thrown, there is only one chance

                                    change them to decimals, percentages, ratios. Consider the event of throwing a fair die
