                                <p>
                                    Angles are formed when two or more lines or line segments meet or 
                                    intersect at a common point called <strong>vertex</strong>. The measure
                                    of the angle is the amount of rotation or turn around the fixed point.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It can also be described as the amount of rotation or turn needed to align
                                    two lines sharing the same vertex together, or how much one line will
                                    need to turn in order to be inline with the other line.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The unit of measurement for angles are <strong>degrees (&deg;)</strong>, 
                                    radians or gradians. In our study, we will only be using degrees (&deg;) to
                                    measure angles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Angles play a fundamental role in life and are used to describe shapes,
                                    positions and movements of objects.
                                    They can be classified into different types depending on their measure.
                                </p>

                                <p>The types of angles we have are:</p>
                                <p>
                                    1. Acute angles <br>
                                    2. Right angles <br>

                                    5. Reflex angles
                                </p>

                                <h3>Acute angles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Angles that are less than 90&deg; are called acute angles. 
                                    Here are some examples of acute angles:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    1. 30 degrees (30&deg;) <br>
                                    2. 45 degrees (45&deg;) <br>
                                    3. 60 degrees (60&deg;) <br>
                                    4. 75 degrees (75&deg;) 
                                </p>

                                <h3>Right angles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Angles that are exactly 90 degrees (90&deg;) are called right angles.
                                    They are formed when two lines meet to form a perfect "L" shape. Any two
                                    lines that join to form a right angle are called <strong>perpendicular lines</strong>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Example of right angles are the corner of rooms and buildings, such as your classroom. 
                                    They can be found in square and rectangular shapes.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Obtuse angles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Obtuse angles are angles that are wider than right angles but less than straight angles.
                                    In other words, they are more than 90&deg; but less than 180&deg;.
                                </p>

                                <p>Here are some examples of obtuse angles:</p>

                                <p>
                                    1. 120 degrees (120&deg;)<br>
                                    2. 135 degrees (135&deg;)<br>
                                    3. 150 degrees (150&deg;)<br>
                                    4. 165 degrees (165&deg;)
                                </p>

                                <h3>Straight angles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Straight angles are also known as straight lines, and are angles that
                                    are 180&deg; in measure. They are formed when two lines meet at 180&deg;, 
                                    forming a straight line.
                                </p>

                                <p>Every straight line can be said to have an angle of 180&deg;.

                                Examples of straight lines are edges of tables, straight roads etc.</p>

                                <h3>Reflex angles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Angles that are wider than straight angles are called reflex angles. 
                                    That is, they are greater than 180&deg; but less than 360&deg;. They are
                                    formed when a line is folded or bent back upon itself, making it greater
                                    wider than straight lines but less than a full circle.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    You can use the protractor to measure the size of angles. You can also
                                    use the protractor to draw angles. In this lesson, we will learn how to use
                                    the protractor to draw angles such as 30&deg;, 45&deg;, 60&deg;, 75&deg; 
                                    90&deg;, 120&deg;, 150&deg;, 270&deg; and 300&deg;.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The video below describes how to use the protractor to
                                    draw and measure angles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Angle 45&deg; is obtained by bisecting the right angle (angle 90&deg;)
                                    into two.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Watch the video below to learn how to construct angle 90&deg; and angle 45&deg; with 
                                    the compass.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Remember to practice while you watch the video to become good at constructing
                                    the angle on your own. And don't forget to use the right tool for the right job.
